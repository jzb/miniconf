# Rocket and the App Container Spec

## Speaker: Brandon Philips

## Description: 

Rocket is a simple daemon-free tool that enables users to run containerized apps on their systems free of host dependencies.  Containers running under rocket execute like regular processes and can be managed using existing process management tools like upstart, systemd, runit, and etcd.

Rocket is also an implementation of the "App Container Spec" which defines how to define and build containerized applications based on tooling like tar and pgp. And then host these files easily using standard protocols like HTTP. The goal of the spec is to enable independent and creative implementations of container runtimes and build tools.

Both of these projects are open source and part of a young growing community. Come learn how they work and how you can get involved.
