## Description:

Galera is the synchronous replication plugin for MySQ, which implements the write-set replication API (WSREP) present in Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC).  Linux containers provide isolation to processes and contain them while ensuring bare-metal performance, without any overhead of operating system or full-scale virtualization. Docker, while being a late entrant to this field, has introduced many novel approaches that makes it easy to configure, build, manage and deploy the containers.
